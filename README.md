## Ruby Roadshow

A shared repository for Ruby enthusiasts to collectively solve problems.

## How it works

1. I set a problem that can be found in problems/
2. You attempt to solve the problem
3. You push your solution to solutions/[problem]/[your name]/
4. Everyone benefits by comparing solutions

## What if I get stuck?

If you get stuck, ask your colleagues for help or look through other solutions.

If anything's unclear, ask a question in the 'FAQ' section of the problem.

## What's the point?

In addition to learning loads of Ruby goodness, there will be prizes.

I'll be looking for innovative solutions, clean refactors and hard work.
